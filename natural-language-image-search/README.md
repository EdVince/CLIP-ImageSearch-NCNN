# Unsplash Image Search

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/haltakov/natural-language-image-search/blob/main/colab/unsplash-image-search.ipynb)

Search photos on Unsplash using natural language descriptions. The search is powered by OpenAI's [CLIP model](https://github.com/openai/CLIP) and the [Unsplash Dataset](https://unsplash.com/data).

## How It Works?

OpenAI's [CLIP](https://openai.com/blog/clip/) neural networs is able to transform both images and text into the same latent space, where they can be compared using a similarity measure.

For this project all photos from the full [Unsplash Dataset](https://unsplash.com/data) (almost 2M photos) were downloaded and processed with CLIP.

The precomputed feature vectors for all images can then be used to find the best match to a natural language search query.

## How To Run The Code?

### On Google Colab

If you just want to play around with different queries jump to the [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/haltakov/natural-language-image-search/blob/main/colab/unsplash-image-search.ipynb).

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/haltakov/natural-language-image-search/blob/main/colab/unsplash-image-search.ipynb)

### On your machine

Before running any of the code, make sure to install all dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you want to run all the code yourself open the Jupyter notebooks in the order they are numbered and follow the instructions there:

- `01-setup-clip.ipynb` - setup the environment checking out and preparing the CLIP code.
- `02-download-unsplash-dataset.ipynb` - download the photos from the Unsplash dataset
- `03-process-unsplash-dataset.ipynb` - process all photos from the dataset with CLIP
- `04-search-image-dataset.ipynb` - search for a photo in the dataset using natural language queries
- `09-search-image-api.ipynb` - search for a photo using the Unsplash Search API and filter the results using CLIP.

> NOTE: only the Lite version of the Unsplash Dataset is publicly available. If you want to use the Full version, you will need to [apply](https://unsplash.com/data) for (free) access.

> NOTE: searching for images using the Unsplash Search API doesn't require access to the Unsplash Dataset, but will probably deliver worse results.
